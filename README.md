Water quality monitoring systems play a critical role in safeguarding human health and environmental sustainability by assessing and maintaining the quality of water resourc
This abstract provides an overview of such systems, highlighting their importance, components, methods, and applications. 
Water quality monitoring involves the systematic measurement and analysis of physical, chemical, and biological parameters to evaluate the suitability of water for various uses.
Key parameters commonly monitored include temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, conductivity, and concentrations of pollutants such as nutrients, heavy metals, and pathogens.
Monitoring can be conducted using a combination of in-situ sensors, remote sensing technologies, and laboratory analysis.
In-sit sensors are deployed directly in water bodies to provide real-time data, while remote sensing techniques utilize satellites or aerial platforms to assess water quality over larger spatial scales.
Laboratory analysis offers high precision and accuracy
