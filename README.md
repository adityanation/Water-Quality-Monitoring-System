Water Quality Management System

Introduction

The Water Quality Management System is a Python-based application designed to monitor and manage water quality efficiently. It provides functionalities for analyzing water samples, tracking pollution levels, generating reports, and ensuring regulatory compliance. This system is useful for environmental agencies, water treatment plants, and research institutions.

Features

Add, update, and delete water quality records

Analyze water parameters (pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, etc.)

Monitor pollution levels and trends

Generate detailed reports and visualizations

Ensure regulatory compliance with water safety standards

Provide alerts for contamination detection

Technologies Used

Python (Core language)

Flask (For web-based interface, if applicable)

SQLite/MySQL (For database management)

Tkinter (For GUI-based applications, if applicable)

Pandas (For data handling)

Matplotlib/Seaborn (For data visualization)

Scikit-learn (For predictive analysis, if applicable)

Installation

Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system (>=3.7). You can download it from Python's official website.

Steps

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/water-quality-management-system.git
cd water-quality-management-system

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up the database:

python setup_database.py

Run the application:

python main.py

If using Flask for a web-based system, start the server:

flask run

Usage

Launch the application and navigate through the menu to access various features.

Use the "Add Water Sample" option to register a new water quality record.

Monitor pollution trends and analyze water quality over time.

Generate reports for regulatory compliance and research purposes.

Set up alerts for contamination detection.
